##How to install and use
1. Download the zipped version of my file or copy paste it from the raw section(you can find it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romponu/EasyLib2/master/EasyLib2.java). 
2. Make a folder called "EasyLib2" and place the "EasyLib2.java" in it.
3. Move that folder in your java DIR.
4. Import it like you would any other java class: import EasyLib2.EasyLib2;
5. Instantiate the class: EasyLib2 e = new EasyLib2();

##Known Bugs/Problems
Some functions cause depreciation, this is due to the newest JDK having many new librarys that I am still learning about.

Looping when creating a file or writing a file can cause some processing problems while your program is open.
